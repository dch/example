This example app is a mix of whatever makes things useful, a template
for building future applications off.

It covers:

- release generation
- logging
- monitoring
- test,dev, and run-time configs
- CI support
- message queue pub/sub

Interfaces (structs, APIs, GenServers etc) are part of domain
architecture, and not covered here.
